ALU Full Adder in VHDL
This project implements both a 1-bit and a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) full adder using Intel VHDL software. The full adders are designed to perform binary addition with support for carry-in and carry-out operations.

Features
1-bit Full Adder: Implements basic addition for single-bit inputs with carry management.
16-bit Full Adder: Extends the functionality to handle 16-bit binary addition, incorporating the 1-bit full adder design.
Testing: Comprehensive test cases have been developed to verify the functionality of both adders.

Project Structure
1_bit_full_adder.vhd: VHDL code for the 1-bit full adder.
16_bit_full_adder.vhd: VHDL code for the 16-bit full adder.
testbench.vhd: Testbench for validating the functionality of the adders.

How to Use
Open the Project: Launch Intel VHDL software and open the project files.
Compile the Code: Ensure there are no errors and compile the VHDL files.
Run the Testbench: Execute the testbench to observe the results of the adders.

Testing
The project includes test cases that validate the output of both the 1-bit and 16-bit full adders against expected results, ensuring accuracy and reliability in addition operations
